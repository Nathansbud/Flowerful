# Shroomful (fka Flowerful)

This repository holds the final project submission for CSCI 1230 for [Zack Amiton](https://github.com/Nathansbud) (zamiton) & [Eva Schiller](https://github.com/eschill04) (eschill04). 

## Installation

- This project requires the [Qt Multimedia](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtmultimedia-index.html) library, which is not installed by default
- glm, glew, and any other required libraries are included and should work as-is

## Features

- Fog Effect
- Pixel Shader
- Texture Mapping
- Music-Based Mushroom Animation
	- For the purposes of our demo, our BPM values were hardcoded in, using files loaded in `desktop/resources/demo/audio`; future work will hopefully make this more general, using signal processing to work for any loaded audiofiles

## Credits
